# CHANGELOG

## dev-master
Some minor updates and changes ahead of some major refactoring plans. 

Introduced `FailoverAirIntakeSystem` for handling intake shutter when 
thermocouple fails to get readings (automatic switch is yet to be implemented).

Introduced `Event::onDispatch()` method to allow events do some tasks when
being dispatched (used for audio notifications).

Implemented `BuzzerTestCommand` for buzzer tests.

Implemented `Buzzer` and `BuzzerNotes` for audio notifications. 

Introduced `AirIntakeCalibrateCommand` for intake calibration.

Implemented linear correction for sensors.

Multiple changes and fixes. First alpha-state reached.

`System` classes rewritten for `EventDispatcher`.

Plugged `HellfireServer` cyclic calls to `EventDispatcher`.

Implemented CommonTraits for widely used getters and setters.

Implemented basic events.

Added vendor `symfony/event-dispatcher`.

`AirIntakeTestCommand` added for servo basic testing.

`AirIntakeSystem` further implementation done.

`AnalogServo` rebuild and logic simplified.

Readme updated.

Initial air intake boostrap.

Deleted obsolete `TemperatureSensor` class.

Added note for relays setup about pin numeration (BCM). Shall introduce mapper
 some day to solve it permanently.

Implemented `FixPermissionsInstallCommand` and `RelaysTestCommand`.

Refactored hellfire commands. Commands are split into three groups so far:
 `install`, `server`, `test`.

Lots of code quality fixes.

Vendor updated.

`PumpTrait`, `SensorArrayTrait` implemented to reduce code duplication.
  
`AirIntakeSystem` implemented as middle layer for servo control.

`DataSource` values Database storage implemented.

`Element` classes renamed to `System` and their further implementation done.

Bootstrapping implemented & pimple container setup.

Several bug-fixes.

Vendor updated.

Basic Command classes implemented.

`AnalogServo` class implemented for servo steering. 

`ComponentArray` classes implemented for managing arrays of DataSources.

`HellfireServer` prototype.

`Relay` prototype for relay control.

`CreateStorageComand`, `HellfireServerCommand` and `W1ServerCommand` prototypes.

Cleanups after extracting MAX6675, MCP3008, 1-wire code into separate
repositories (see composer.json for reference).
